# Workstation Configuration

Shell script to automate desktop installations and configurations for a web developer.

## Compatibility

Tests were performed on Linux Mint 19.2, 19.20, Ubuntu 19.10 and 20.04.

## Setup

You must copy the file `setup.sh.example`, rename it to` setup.sh.` and edit the file informing what you want to install or not.

To do this simply open the file and inform with `true` or `false` what you want to install.

If you want an entire block not to be installed, hit `false` that it will not be executed.

## How to run the script

1. Download this repository.
2. Unzip.
3. Go to the directory unzipped by the terminal.
4. Run the command:

```
./install.sh
```

The process will ask if you want to continue

**Because a lot of software is installed, it may take a long time, depending on your internet connection.**

**Log**

At the end of the process a log file is generated.

Path: /log/installation_log.txt
